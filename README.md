# user-simulator
Configurable Discord chatbot that learns from users

# Features

- talks to users

- permanently saves things it learned to a database

- can have a rough understanding of what you're talking about

# Note
It's a good idea to take a look at the usersim.js file first and change the configuration if you want to. The only thing you *have* to do is set the TOKEN variable to whatever the token of your bot is.

# How do I get the token?
https://discord.com/developers/applications and create an application with a bot user

# Installing

- npm install

- make a script that starts the bot

- if everything goes right, you'll have your own chatbot

# Config

`LEARNS_FROM` - array of channel names the bot will learn messages from

`TALKS_IN` - array of channel names the bot talks in

`TOKEN` - pretty obvious

# Contributing

All contributions that make the bot overall better or fix things are welcome.
